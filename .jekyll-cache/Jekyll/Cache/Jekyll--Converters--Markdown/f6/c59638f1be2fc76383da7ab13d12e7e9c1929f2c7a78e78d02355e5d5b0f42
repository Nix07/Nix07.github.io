I"—<p>This Spring semester (2025), I officially achieved PhD candidacy at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences, having completed both my coursework and the paper requirementâ€”demonstrating my ability to conduct research. Iâ€™m deeply grateful to my advisor, Prof. David Bau, and my labmates for their support. Looking forward to an even more enriching and enjoyable journey through the rest of my PhD!</p>
