I"&	<p>I am a senior undergraduate student at the <a href="https://rvce.edu.in/">RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India</a> (expected graduation in August 2020).</p>

<p>During this winter and last summer, I interned at <a href="https://kixlab.org/">KIXLAB</a> and worked under the supervision of <a href="http://juhokim.com/">Dr. Juho Kim</a>, associate professor at KAIST. Previously, I have interned at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b">Samsung R&amp;D Institute India - Bangalore (SRIB)</a>, <a href="http://sccilabs.org/">SCCI Labs</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/sudarshan-iyengar">Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar</a>, associate professor at Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, &amp; <a href="https://hasura.io/">Hasura Technologies</a>.</p>

<p>Although my research interests are still evolving, I am broadly interested to explore the domain of <strong>Human-AI Interaction</strong>, <strong>Human-Centered AI</strong>, and <strong>Interactive Machine Learning</strong>, ie. the entire spectrum of human interaction with machine intelligence, from making AI accessible for everyone to understanding the impact of AI in human lives as well as building <strong>reliable intelligent systems</strong>, by combining machine and human intelligence, that support <strong>interaction at scale</strong> for solving social-computational problems. In this respect, I am currently learning about <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>human-computer interaction</strong>.</p>

<p>Apart from these topics, I am also interested in <strong>Computational Social Science</strong>, <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>, and <strong>Data Science</strong>, specifically in understanding and modeling human behavior in technological systems such as <strong>online social networks</strong> and <strong>Wikipedia</strong>. And I am always open to new exciting research problems in other related domains!</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, documentaries, and Anime (big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">Naruto</a> だってばよ!), as well as playing chess and table tennis.</p>
