<h3 id="things-we-wish-wed-said">Things we wish we‚Äôd said</h3>

<ul>
  <li>more on the tenure/evaluation process (sorry, maybe next time!)</li>
  <li>interview process: not only are they interviewing you, but you should think of it as interviewing them (two way street)</li>
  <li>individual interviews: they have no idea what to ask, either. so, use that as an opportnity to interview THEM ‚Äì do YOU want to be HERE?</li>
  <li>you can make a lot of plans, but you can only make the decision to make if you have an offer. so, set yourself up. does anyone actually want to hire you? only know that if you try.</li>
  <li>interview process is long, but many people rely on <strong>snap judgements</strong> that they come up with within the first 10 minutes. The first 10 minute matter. First impressions count. Come across as an interesting person that would be fun/good to work with. Avoid coming across as an unlikeable person. Dress well, groom yourself. They are also assessing whether you can communicate and have good communication skills. Can you speak, are you intelligible, etc.</li>
