I"'<p>I’m a second year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>, advised by <a href="https://baulab.info/">Prof. David Bau</a>. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from <a href="https://rvce.edu.in/">RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India</a> in fall 2020, with a focus on electrical and computer science.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked as a visiting scholar at the <a href="https://asiabiega.github.io/">Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy</a>, a research intern at both the <a href="https://www.kixlab.org/">Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology</a> and the <a href="https://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Ropar</a>, and as a student trainee at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b">Samsung Research Bangalore</a>.</p>

<p>Broadly, my interest lies in understanding the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks to enhance human-AI collaboration and prevent misalignment. Currently, I’m investigating cognitive abilities such as <em>reasoning</em> and <em>theory of mind</em> in large language models.</p>

<p>I have received invaluable support from many people throughout my career, and as a result, I’m always happy to assist others and share insights from my experiences. Please feel free to reach out.</p>
