I"T<p>I’m a second year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Khoury College of Computer Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a> and working with <a href="https://baulab.info/">Prof. David Bau</a>. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from <a href="https://rvce.edu.in/">RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India</a> in fall 2020, with a focus on electrical and computer science.</p>

<p>Before starting my Ph.D., I was working as a visiting scholar at Responsible Computing Group, supervised by <a href="https://asiabiega.github.io/">Prof. Asia J. Biega</a>. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at <a href="https://kixlab.org/">KIXLAB</a> and worked under the supervision of <a href="http://juhokim.com/">Prof. Juho Kim</a>, <a href="http://sccilabs.org/">SCCI Labs</a> supervised by <a href="http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/sudarshan-iyengar">Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar</a>, and <a href="https://hasura.io/">Hasura Technologies</a>. Following my graduation, I worked at <a href="https://www.accolite.com/">Accolite</a> as a senior software engineer. In parallel, I also conducted research under the supervision of <a href="http://ujwalgadiraju.com/">Prof. Ujwal Gadiraju</a> and <a href="https://en.cs.uni-paderborn.de/css">Prof. Henning Wachsmuth</a>.</p>

<p>Broadly, my interest lies in understanding the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks to enhance human-AI collaboration and prevent misalignment. Currently, I’m investigating cognitive abilities such as <em>reasoning</em> and <em>theory of mind</em> in large language models.</p>
