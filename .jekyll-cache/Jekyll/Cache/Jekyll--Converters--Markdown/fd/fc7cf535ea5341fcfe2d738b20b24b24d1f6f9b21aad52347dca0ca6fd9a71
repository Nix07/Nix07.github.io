<ul>
  <li>Defend the choices that you made in conducting the research ‚Äì know /why/ you did what you did. Understand the weaknesses of your choices, and be open to considering some of the suggestions posed by the examiners.</li>
  <li>Be critical, and be ready to think and reflect on the comments that you hear.</li>
  <li>There are some questions that examiners have an answer in their head about. In other cases, they really don‚Äôt.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<p>So, to me there are three types of questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>[Clarification] I don‚Äôt understand X. Can you explain it in further detail?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[Justification] Explain/justify the choice of X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[Speculation] What would you do next on this project?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can cross this with any of the major sections of your paper (e.g. Problem, Motivation, Approach, Implementation, Discussion, Conclusion) to get a sense for what the questions might be like. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clarification/Problem: I don‚Äôt understand how this visualization works. Can you explain it to me again?</li>
  <li>Justification/Approach: Why did you convert mood into an ordinal (numerical) scale? Was this the right choice to make? How could you have done it differently?</li>
  <li>Speculation/Problem: Would you expect this data collection to happen automatically in the future? How would the results you got differ if you‚Äôd collected a different kind of data? Is this the best type of visualization for this data? How might you change it?</li>
</ul>
