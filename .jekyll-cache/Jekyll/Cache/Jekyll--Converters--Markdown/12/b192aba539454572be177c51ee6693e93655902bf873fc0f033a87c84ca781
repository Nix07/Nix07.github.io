I"5<p><a href="https://www.serimats.org/program">SERI-MATS</a> is a research program aimed at providing support and mentorship to individual who are interesting reducing risks from unaligned AI. It has three phases: 1) Training, 2) Research, and 3) Extension. There are multiple mentors associated with the prgram who are experts in various subdomain of AI alignment. Each of those mentors select a handful of participants for the training phase, which last for 1 month. During this phase, participants are expected to read and learn about the research that they are interested in exploring during the next phase.</p>

<p>I was selected in the mechanistic interpretability stream, specifically with <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/about">Neel Nanda</a>. In addition to reading papers and covering ARENA curriculum, I also explored superposition in attention heads that extract factual information from the subject token residual stream. Although, the results were not very satisfactory, it was still a great experience. Hopefully, next time Iâ€™ll get to the research phase</p>
