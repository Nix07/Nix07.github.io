I"Í<p>Iâ€™m pleased to announce that we have been awarded a grant from <strong>Googleâ€™s Gemma Academic Program</strong>, which provides us with $5,000 in credits for the Google Cloud Platform. Iâ€™m grateful for Googleâ€™s support through their academic program. This grant will enable us to perform the training and experiments with frontier language models. I hope it will bring us closer to understanding the cognitive abilities of large language models.</p>
