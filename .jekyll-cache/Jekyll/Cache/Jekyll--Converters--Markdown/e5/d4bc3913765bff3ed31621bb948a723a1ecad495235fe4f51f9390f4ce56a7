I"[<p>I am a senior undergraduate student at the <a href="https://rvce.edu.in/">RV College of Engineering, Bangalore</a>. I will be joining <a href="https://kixlab.org/">KIXLAB</a> and working under the superision of <a href="http://juhokim.com/">Prof. Juho Kim</a> during next the winter semester as a visiting student researcher. Previously, I have interned at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b">Samsung R&amp;D Institute India - Bangalore (SRIB)</a>, <a href="http://sccilabs.org/">SCCI Labs @Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar</a> &amp; <a href="https://hasura.io/">Hasura Technologies</a>.</p>

<p>I am broadly interested in problems that lie at the intersection of Computer Science and Social Sciences, specific domains include <strong>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong>, <strong>Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)</strong>, and <strong>Human-Centered Machine Learning</strong>. And I am always open to new exciting research problems in other related domains!</p>

<p>Recently, I have been focusing on data-driven interactive systems that support interaction at scale for solving social-computational problems. I am also interested in theoretical and experimental research to better understand and model human behavior in technological systems.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, TV series, and Anime (big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto">Naruto</a> だってばよ!), and playing table tennis.</p>

<p><span style="color:red"><strong>I am currently looking for research assistantship and long-term internship (6-12 months) opportunities.</strong></span></p>
