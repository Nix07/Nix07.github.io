<p>Iâ€™m interested in exploring the intersection of <strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (AI) in order to develop better <strong>Human-AI Collaboration</strong> techniques for <strong>Human-Centered AI</strong> systems.</p>

<!-- the space of **Human-AI Interaction**, i.e. the entire spectrum of human interaction with machine intelligence, from making AI accessible for everyone to understanding the impact of AI in human lives as well as building **Human-Centered AI** systems, for solving social-computational problems. -->
