I"“<p>Iâ€™m a forth year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>, advised by <a href="https://baulab.info/">Prof. David Bau</a>. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from <a href="https://rvce.edu.in/">RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India</a> in fall 2020, with a focus on electrical and computer science.</p>

<p>Last summer, Iâ€™m interned at Apple in the <a href="https://vis.aiml.apple.com">AIML Visualization</a> team to work on mechanistic interpretability of math reasoining in LLMs. Previously, Iâ€™ve interned at <a href="https://prair.group/">Practical AI Alignment and Interpretability Research Group</a> with <a href="https://atticusg.github.io/">Dr. Atticus Geiger</a> and <a href="https://www.matsprogram.org">SERI-MATS</a> (first phrase) with <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/about">Neel Nanda</a>. Prior to that, I worked as a visiting scholar at the <a href="https://asiabiega.github.io/">Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy</a>, and had stints at <a href="https://www.kixlab.org/">Korea Advanced Institute of Science &amp; Technology</a> and <a href="https://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Ropar</a>.</p>

<p>Broadly, my interest lies in understanding the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks to enhance human-AI collaboration and prevent misalignment. Currently, Iâ€™m investigating cognitive abilities such as reasoning and theory of mind in large language models.</p>

<p>I have received invaluable support from many people throughout my career, and as a result, Iâ€™m always happy to assist others and share insights from my experiences. Please feel free to reach out.</p>
