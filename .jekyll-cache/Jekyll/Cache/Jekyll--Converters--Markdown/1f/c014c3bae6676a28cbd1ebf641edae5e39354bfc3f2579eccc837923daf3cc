I"ú<p>I had a wonderful experience interning with the Visualization team at Apple this summer. Iâ€™m especially grateful to my manager, Yannick, and the entire team for being so supportive and great to work with. Over the summer, I focused on developing a fine-tuning approach informed by mechanistic interpretability, aimed at improving specific model capabilities while minimizing regressions on other skills learned during pre-training. Iâ€™m hopeful that weâ€™ll be able to submit this work to ICLR 2026!</p>

<p>Although I was based in Boston, I was fortunate to have the chance to visit Apple Park for an HCI workshop on Responsible AI, hosted by the Human-Centered Machine Intelligence organization. It was an amazing opportunity to meet many Apple researchers and faculty members, and it made for an unforgettable first experience in the Bay Area!</p>
