I"”<p>Iâ€™m a second year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>, advised by <a href="https://baulab.info/">Prof. David Bau</a>. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from <a href="https://rvce.edu.in/">RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India</a> in fall 2020, with a focus on electrical and computer science.</p>

<!-- Before starting my Ph.D., I was working as a visiting scholar at Responsible Computing Group, supervised by [Prof. Asia J. Biega](https://asiabiega.github.io/). During my undergraduate studies, I interned at [KIXLAB](https://kixlab.org/) and worked under the supervision of [Prof. Juho Kim](http://juhokim.com/), [SCCI Labs](http://sccilabs.org/) supervised by [Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar](http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/sudarshan-iyengar), and [Hasura Technologies](https://hasura.io/). Following my graduation, I worked at [Accolite](https://www.accolite.com/) as a senior software engineer. In parallel, I also conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Ujwal Gadiraju](http://ujwalgadiraju.com/) and [Prof. Henning Wachsmuth](https://en.cs.uni-paderborn.de/css). -->

<p>Broadly, my interest lies in understanding the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks to enhance human-AI collaboration and prevent misalignment. Currently, Iâ€™m investigating cognitive abilities such as <em>reasoning</em> and <em>theory of mind</em> in large language models.</p>
