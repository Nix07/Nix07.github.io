After months of hard work that went into preparing and submitting my applications to multiple Ph.D. programs as well as subsequent interviews, I'm delighted to announce that I'll be starting my Ph.D. at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in Boston, Massachusetts next fall! I'll be working with [Prof. David Bau](https://baulab.info/), at the intersection of HCI and AI, on Human-Centered AI.

This wouldn't be real without the constant support from my mentors. In particular, I'd like to thank [Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/sudarshan-iyengar) for igniting the spark of research in me. [Prof. Juho Kim](https://juhokim.com/) and other KIXLAB members for transforming that spark into a wildfire. [Prof. Ujwal Gadiraju](http://ujwalgadiraju.com/) and [Prof. Henning Wachsmuth](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/person/3900/) for channelizing that fire and helping me develop my research insights. But most importantly, I want to thank them, as well as my current supervisor [Prof. Asia Biega](https://asiabiega.github.io/), for believing in me!

In addition to supervisors, my collaborators cum friends have also been very influential in my decision to pursue a Ph.D. I'd like to thank them for their support and precious company. I hope to see them at future conferences.

Finally, I'm so excited about my Ph.D. life in Boston. I'm looking forward to making many new friends, learning about American history, trying out new sports, and going on walks with huskies! Please let me know if you have any recommendations for places to visit or restaurants to try in Boston. -->
