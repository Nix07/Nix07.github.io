During my stay at Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP), I investigated the well-being of microtask crowdworkers. More specifically, I conducted exploratory studies to understand the various dimensions of workers' well-being, their status quo, and a few other related stuff. It was a challenging endeavor since I didn't have a background in digital well-being. Furthermore, I had to read a lot of psychological works rather than more traditional computer science literature. However, it also helped me learn a ton of new concepts and perspectives.

This opportunity was also quite unique due to the diverse cohort of lab mates. Students and researchers from various disciplines such as humanities, human computer interaction, electrical engineering, and computer science used to participate in the lab meeting that made the discussion fascinating and educational. Hopefully, I would get to meet all of them in-person some day!:crossed_fingers:

Overall, it was a fantastic experience for which I will be eternally grateful to Prof. Beiga! Danke schön! :smiley: -->
