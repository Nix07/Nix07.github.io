      <p>Graduate school is a unique experience for each person. Choosing to do a thesis-based degree is an even more interesting journey, as this demands a high level of self-discipline and will-power. There may be moments of self-doubt and of frustration, but there will be moments of joy, elation, and sublime satisfaction.</p>

<p>A big determinant of this experience – both good and bad – is one’s relationship with one’s thesis supervisor. This document outlines my working style, and my expectations of you as a supervisee. It is a working “default,” where there may be individual variations depending on circumstances (both temporary and ongoing). If you expect to need to vary from these defaults, then it is incumbent upon you to initiate the discussion with me. Similarly, if there is something you are uncertain about, please raise this in a discussion with me.</p>

<p>When I choose to work with you, I am committing to your success. For me, success is a bit degree-dependent, but largely, it means that I have done a good job <em>preparing you to be an academic researcher in UX/HCI</em>. It is important that you consider my success metric, because it may be in variance to yours! To develop you into a good academic researcher, I see my role as facilitating your development along six areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Literacy in HCI domain: You will be conversant about HCI research, and be able to think about and discuss HCI research broadly with other reserachers. This includes especially understanding the wide space of research, and how to respectfully think about others’ work.</li>
  <li>Literacy in the HCI methods: You know how to conduct research with at least one method (developing a deep understanding of it), and broadly understand the space of various HCI research methods.</li>
  <li>HCI prototyping: You will be able to design prototypes for research evaluations, and understand the tradeoffs in different prototyping methods.</li>
  <li>Writing: You will be able to recognize the writing style of academic HCI research, and to be able to mimic this writing style to communicate your research results.</li>
  <li>Communication: You will be able to give research talks in a style that is appropriate for an HCI researcher, and be able to represent the research work that you do.</li>
  <li>Scientific/Design Critique: You will learn how to critique research and design work – that is, to be able to express opinion that is backed by research – constructively in ways that help support others’ ongoing work. By the same token, you will learn how to use others’ feedback to improve your own work.</li>
</ol>

<p>To this point, many of the practices that I have with my research advisees is aimed at building their competency in these six areas.</p>

<p>As your supervisor, I expect to <strong>supervise your research</strong> that you are doing. My style is one where I expect to be involved in the development of your research ideas, your research process, and to a large extent, the execution of your research, including the development of your writing and presentation of the work. I consider myself to be fairly hands-on, though this will vary somewhat in a PhD program as you develop competencies (and your own voice) and need me less over time.</p>

<p>With that said, I still do think of your research as being <strong>your research</strong>. This means that the primary source of ideas should still be yours, where you develop these ideas, build out prototypes and think about and pursue deeper thought on these ideas on your own. That is, the work still depends on your initiative. My job is to supervise and hone your thinking, and to support you as you go through this.</p>

<p>I like to think of myself as someone who gives tough love and says it as it is, but the reality is that I avoid conflict at almost all cost. I will always provide feedback, but am sometimes not as great at giving negative feedback. This is something that I am continuing to work on.</p>

<h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>

<p>Meetings are a crucial part of how I supervise students. These include  planned, on-demand and impromptu meetings. My expectation for these meetings it that work on “world time” – that is, they start on time.</p>

<p><strong>1-1 Meeting.</strong> Minimally, I expect to see students at least one time at a regular, 1-1 meeting (usually 30 mins). We will use this time to get a quick update on your progress, as well as outlining your ongoing progress and plan for the upcoming week. We will also use this time to discuss challenges you are having, and for me to provide additional guidance as necessary. For these meetings, I have the following expectations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will drive the meeting – that is to say, you set the agenda and plan for the meeting: what are we going to talk about, and what do we need to spend time discussing.</li>
  <li>You have made progress since the last time we met.</li>
  <li>You are able to articulate the progress you have made, and able to set goals for the coming week that are actionable and measurable.</li>
  <li>You <strong>take notes</strong> during our meeting.</li>
  <li>If one of us cannot make the meeting, that you send an email is in lieu of our meeting with the same basic components of our meeting (progress, plan, challenges).</li>
  <li>If you want me to review some writing to discuss during our meeting, then ensuring that it is sent to me with at least a full business day before our meeting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>On Demand Meetings.</strong> Sometimes, we establish these when you are going through some particularly difficult section of your research (e.g. building a prototype, or doing an analysis). In this case, we will set aside a mutually agreed upon time to do this. Please ask for these if you need them.</p>

<p><strong>Impromptu Meetings.</strong> I am available for impromptu meetings as necessary. Please drop by, fire me a message or an email as necessary, and I will do my best to accommodate.</p>

<h2 id="being-part-of-ricelab-and-the-ischool-hciux-research-community">Being Part of RICELab, and the iSchool HCI/UX Research Community</h2>

<p>A critical part of your development is to be a part of a research community. I build this through my RICELab group, and through the iSchool HCI/UX Reading Group.</p>

<p>I expect you to be a part of RICELab meetings, which will meet once a week, and to contribute to these meetings.</p>

<p>I expect you to attend and participate in the iSchool HCI/UX Reading Group at least once every two weeks. You will present a paper at the reading group at least once a term.</p>

<p>These meetings give you the opportunity to develop communication and critique skills.</p>

<p>Being a part of RICELab comes with various expectations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Within the research group, I expect you to be supportive of one another’s work. Critique is good, but this needs to be provided constructively and with suggestions for how to improve work.</li>
  <li>Occasionally, I will ask you to demonstrate or discuss your work with visitors. This is important to support the health of the lab.</li>
  <li>Externally, when you are acting as a researcher, you represent the group (and me!), and so I expect that you represent yourself, us, and me in socially appropriate ways.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<p>I use a variety of communication methods, including email, WhatsApp, and I have also been persuaded to use Slack at various times. I will use WhatsApp and email to communicate with RICELab, and I expect you to be responsive on those two communication mediums with me.</p>

<p>Generally, I will respond to your queries within a day (even if it just to acknowledge a message). I will generally expect you to be similarly responsive (i.e. within 24h, aside from weekends).</p>

<p><strong>I do not expect you to be responsive outside of your working hours.</strong> But, please advise me of your typical working hours, so I can understand when you are likely to respond.</p>

<h2 id="working-and-relaxing">Working and Relaxing</h2>

<p>As a member of the RICELab, I expect that you will <em>work in the lab</em>. You are welcome to do your school work in the lab, and when it does not disturb others in the lab, to invite group members (say for class projects) into the lab to do your work.</p>

<p>I expect you to be in the lab for core hours (10am - 4pm) aside from your class times, work, lunch and breaks. This facilitates casual meetings between you and others, as well as with me.</p>

<p>My expectations on this vary a bit depending your degree program, and your stage within the program.</p>

<p>My working hours are generally 9-4 on weekdays, and I will occasionally check in on email in the evening. During heavy writing periods, I will sometimes be writing in the evenings.</p>

<p>My worst time of the year is around late August through until the end of September. At this time, I am usually trying to write and edit papers for CHI, set up for class, and start up classes again.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to be “on” for all 52 weeks of the year, and take vacation to recharge myself. I expect you to do the same. There are no written rules about this, as far as I can tell, but I expect you to take about three weeks of vacation time each year. This assumes that you are continuing to make good progress, and is aimed to help you take time away from things so you can come back recharged.</p>

<h2 id="outputs">Outputs</h2>

<p>You will <strong>lead</strong> and produce a conference publication (or equivalent) on your research. This will include the academic presentation.</p>

<p>In practice, this means that you lead all aspects of the work, which in HCI typically includes most of the following: brainstorming, background research, design, implementation, study, analysis and writing of first draft. I will be around to assist at every stage, but remember that <em>you</em> are driving the bus. It still needs to be you doing the heavy intellectual lifting, and taking the work into places that we want it to go.</p>

<p>My role at each of these stages will be to provide feedback on the “story”, and to some extent the “presentation” of the story. Research, in my view, is about 50% execution, and then 50% communication. You have no research if you didn’t do anything; similarly, you have no research if you cannot properly tell people about the work you’ve done. My role is to coach you on both of these things (building off the skills you already have), but the key to remember is that <em>you</em> are the one that needs to execute.</p>

<h2 id="writing-conference-or-journal-articles-together">Writing Conference or Journal Articles Together</h2>

<p>When we write together, the expectation is that you will write the first draft of the submission. This includes drafting the outline, as well as drafting the text. I will help you with this in terms of providing feedback at each step of the way, but the key is that I am <em>helping</em> with this first draft.</p>

<p>When we write together, this is a collaborative process that will require multiple rounds of iteration. There are several aspects to this: timing; coordination philosophy; practical matters of coordination.</p>

<h3 id="timing-on-writing">Timing on Writing</h3>

<p>Bringing together a paper for a larger conference is a multi-week process. I do not believe in trying to do things last minute. Ideas coalesce over time and through iteration (see: <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/Randy/Randy/raibert.htm">“good writing is bad writing that was rewritten”</a>). Most of us are not gifted writers, and though the good news is that it is a skill that can be acquired over time.</p>

<p>Generally, my aim is turn writing around to you as quickly as I can. In heavy writing periods, you can expect this to happen within 24-48h. At more typical times, you should <em>expect</em> a one- to two- week turnaround instead.</p>

<p>Building the schedule for writing up a paper submission is critical. For me, we should have a full working draft by no later than three weeks <em>prior</em> to the deadline. This applies to everything: conference submissions, grant submissions, scholarship submissions, etc. These three weeks allows at least two full rounds of revisions – rounds where I will take sections, provide comments or revise them, and then you take the sections back and complete your own (new) revisions based on mine. It is nearly impossible to be doing this when parts of the work aren’t complete, and it is stress inducing to be working on revisions up to the moment that the submission is due. Building a schedule months in advance helps to avoid this.</p>

<p>I cannot emphasize how important this schedule-building is. You will make me a much happier advisor if you do this planning. If you do not do this, I will be grouchy, and I don’t like being grouchy.</p>

<h3 id="coordination">Coordination</h3>

<p>Writing with others demands that we have good coordination practices that prevent us from clobbering each others changes, as well as respecting one anothers’ thoughts and revisions.</p>

<p>Only one person should be working on a section at a time. This helps to allow you (the primary author) to resolve differences between versions (which should only be on different sections).</p>

<h3 id="practical-matters-of-coordination">Practical Matters of Coordination</h3>

<p>When you are done with a section or a draft, then <em>ping me</em> to let me know that it is time for me to take a look at it. I will not otherwise know when I am supposed to look. Understand that this is best done in advance (i.e. you tell me a week in advance), so that I can block out time to read, provide comments and revisions. During heavy writing periods, I will have blocked out chunks of time to work on paper submissions anyway, but keep in mind that you are competing with others for a chunk in my queue.</p>

<p>I usually use Word combined with Dropbox. This means that we have a shared Dropbox folder that we can both edit.</p>

<p>When you begin writing, <em>use the template from the conference.</em> You should download the template, and begin working inside the template – this means using the styles (e.g. Header 1, Normal, etc.) as you write. This will ensure that we do not need to go reformat the paper before submission.</p>

<p>Use track changes so that you and I can both see what the differences were from the last version.</p>

<p>A typical workflow working with me works something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rename the template into something sensible, using a datestamp. (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">telepresence-robot-2019-12-01.docx</code>)</li>
  <li>When you work on it the next day, then copy and paste the file and increment the file name: <code class="highlighter-rouge">telepresence-robot-2019-12-02.docx</code>.</li>
  <li>When I take my pass on it, I will usually append to the filename <code class="highlighter-rouge">+tt</code> – e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">telepresence-robot-2019-12-02+tt.docx</code></li>
  <li>When you open it up next, copy and paste it into <code class="highlighter-rouge">telepresence-robot-2019-12-03.docx</code>, accept all changes, and work through the document. Turn on change tracking.</li>
  <li>When you make fixes based on comments, then remove the comment. If you are still not sure about some comment, then be sure to bring it up by email, or the next time we meet.</li>
  <li>The next version I see (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">telepresence-robot-2019-12-05.docx</code>), I expect all the change tracking to be visible for the changes since the last time I sent it to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have been persuaded at various points to use ShareLaTeX (or something equivalent). I am okay with these environments, though I have generally found that my ability to collaborate with others in these environments to be less effective.</p>

<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>

<p>With good progress, I will generally provide some form of funding to students through the summer.</p>

<p>I will also provide (small) RAships for various tasks through the school term.</p>

<p>For top tier conference and publication venues, I will support conference travel if the student has led a paper. In good funding years, I may also be able to send students that do not have a paper publication.</p>

<h2 id="my-expectations-of-you">My Expectations of You</h2>

<p>My general expectation of you as a student is that you behave professionally.</p>

<p>This means at least the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are responsive to email (or other communication medium)</li>
  <li>You are responsive and responsible to your labmates</li>
  <li>You contribute to the well-being of the lab</li>
  <li>You understand that you are driving the bus when it comes to your research. This means that you are making progress each week between our meetings, and are bringing new ideas and new points of discussion each time we meet.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="personal-situations">Personal Situations</h2>

<p>I understand that from time to time, personal situations may arise that necessitate taking time away, or that sometimes, you need to take a personal health week.</p>

<p>Recognizing when you are about to fall off the cliff (before you do so) is important. If this is happening <em>do your best to speak to me,</em> and we can try to arrange support.</p>

<p>The most important thing here is to communicate and let me know when something is going on in your life. I cannot do much to help you otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="organizing-your-research">Organizing your Research</h2>

<p>For your project, you ought to organize your project folder as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Project [Shared Dropbox Folder]
- Writing
  - CONFERENCE1
    - Archive
    - Submitted
  - CONFERENCE2
- Prototypes [Code]
  - Prototype 1
  - Prototype 2
- Data
  - Raw
  - Processed
- Analysis
- Brainstorming
  - Sketches
- Ethics Application
</code></pre></div></div>
