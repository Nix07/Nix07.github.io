This Spring semester (2025), I officially achieved PhD candidacy at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences, having completed both my coursework and the paper requirementâ€”demonstrating my ability to conduct research. I'm deeply grateful to my advisor, Prof. David Bau, and my labmates for their support. Looking forward to an even more enriching and enjoyable journey through the rest of my PhD!
