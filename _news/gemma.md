I'm pleased to announce that we have been awarded a grant from **Google's Gemma Academic Program**, which provides us with $5,000 in credits for the Google Cloud Platform. I'm grateful for Google's support through their academic program. This grant will enable us to perform the training and experiments with frontier language models. I hope it will bring us closer to understanding the cognitive abilities of large language models.
