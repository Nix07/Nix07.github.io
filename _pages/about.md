I'm a second year Ph.D. student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), advised by [Prof. David Bau](https://baulab.info/). I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from [RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India](https://rvce.edu.in/) in fall 2020, with a focus on electrical and computer science.

Previously, I have worked as a visiting scholar at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://asiabiega.github.io/), a research intern at both the [Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology](https://www.kixlab.org/) and the [Indian Institute of Technology Ropar](https://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/), and as a student trainee at [Samsung Research Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b).

Broadly, my interest lies in understanding the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks to enhance human-AI collaboration and prevent misalignment. Currently, I'm investigating cognitive abilities such as *reasoning* and *theory of mind* in large language models.

I have received invaluable support from many people throughout my career, and as a result, Iâ€™m always happy to assist others and share insights from my experiences. Please feel free to reach out.
