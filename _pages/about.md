I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from [RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India](https://rvce.edu.in/) in fall 2020, with a focus on electrical and computer science.

During winter (2020) and summer (2019), I interned at [KIXLAB](https://kixlab.org/) and worked under the supervision of [Dr. Juho Kim](http://juhokim.com/). Previously, I have interned at [Samsung R&D Institute India - Bangalore (SRIB)](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b), [SCCI Labs](http://sccilabs.org/) supervised by [Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar](http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/sudarshan-iyengar), & [Hasura Technologies](https://hasura.io/). Currently, I'm employed at [Accolite](https://www.accolite.com/) as a senior software engineer as well as conducting research under the supervision of [Dr. Ujwal Gadiraju](http://ujwalgadiraju.com/) and [Dr. Henning Wachsmuth](https://en.cs.uni-paderborn.de/css).  

I’m interested in exploring the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction** and **Artificial Intelligence** (AI), the space of **Human-AI Interaction**, i.e. the entire spectrum of human interaction with machine intelligence, from making AI accessible for everyone to understanding the impact of AI in human lives as well as building **Human-Centered AI** systems, for solving social-computational problems. And I'm completely open to all application areas.

Apart from these topics, I'm also involved in **Computational Social Science**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Data Science**, specifically in understanding and modeling human behavior in technological systems such as **online social networks** and **Wikipedia**.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, documentaries, and Anime (big fan of [Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) だってばよ!), as well as playing chess and table tennis.
