I'm a third year Ph.D. student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), advised by [Prof. David Bau](https://baulab.info/). I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from [RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India](https://rvce.edu.in/) in fall 2020, with a focus on electrical and computer science.

This summer, I'll be interning at Apple to work on mechanistic interpretability of LLMs. During my PhD, I've interned at [Practical AI Alignment and Interpretability Research Group](https://prair.group/) with [Dr. Atticus Geiger](https://atticusg.github.io/) and [SERI-MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org) (first phrase) with [Neel Nanda](https://www.neelnanda.io/about). Prior to that, I worked as a visiting scholar at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://asiabiega.github.io/), and had stints at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology](https://www.kixlab.org/) and [Indian Institute of Technology Ropar](https://cse.iitrpr.ac.in/).

Broadly, my interest lies in understanding the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks to enhance human-AI collaboration and prevent misalignment. Currently, I'm investigating cognitive abilities such as reasoning and theory of mind in large language models.

I have received invaluable support from many people throughout my career, and as a result, Iâ€™m always happy to assist others and share insights from my experiences. Please feel free to reach out.
