I'm a second year Ph.D. student at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) and working with [Prof. David Bau](https://baulab.info/). I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from [RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India](https://rvce.edu.in/) in fall 2020, with a focus on electrical and computer science.


Before starting my Ph.D., I was working as a visiting scholar at Responsible Computing Group, supervised by [Prof. Asia J. Biega](https://asiabiega.github.io/). During my undergraduate studies, I interned at [KIXLAB](https://kixlab.org/) and worked under the supervision of [Prof. Juho Kim](http://juhokim.com/), [SCCI Labs](http://sccilabs.org/) supervised by [Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar](http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/sudarshan-iyengar), and [Hasura Technologies](https://hasura.io/). Following my graduation, I worked at [Accolite](https://www.accolite.com/) as a senior software engineer. In parallel, I also conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Ujwal Gadiraju](http://ujwalgadiraju.com/) and [Prof. Henning Wachsmuth](https://en.cs.uni-paderborn.de/css).

I'm interested in the mechanistic interpretability of large language models, with a focus on understanding and enhancing their capabilities.
