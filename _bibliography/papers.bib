  abstract={Quality control and assurance are among the most important challenges in crowdsourcing. Low quality and sub-optimalresponses from crowdworkers have been found to often result from unclear or incomplete task descriptions, especially from novice or inexperienced task requesters. Creating clear task descriptions with adequate information however, is a complex task for requesters in crowdsourcing marketplaces. To meet this challenge, we present iClarify, a tool that enables requesters to iteratively discover and revise eight common clarity flaws in their task description before deployment on the platform. A requester can use iClarify to formulate a task description from scratch or also to evaluate the clarity of prepared descriptions. The tool employs support vector regression models based on various feature types that were trained on 1332 annotated real-world task descriptions. Using these models, it scores the task description with respect to the eight flaws, and the requester can iteratively edit and evaluate the description until the scores shown by the tool reach a satisfactory level of clarity. We are currently conducting a usability study with both requesters and crowdworkers to assess to which extent the tool is effective in improving task clarity},

  abstract={As artificial intelligence (AI) systems are getting ubiquitous within our society, issues related to its fairness, accountability, and transparency are increasing rapidly. As a result, researchers are integrating humans with AI systems to build robust and reliable hybrid intelligence systems. However, a proper conceptualization of these systems does not underpin this rapid growth. This article provides a precise definition of hybrid intelligence systems as well as explains its relation with other similar concepts through our proposed framework and examples from contemporary literature. The framework breakdowns the relationship between a human and a machine in terms of the degree of coupling and the directive authority of each party. Finally, we argue that all AI systems are hybrid intelligence systems, so human factors need to be examined at every stage of such systems' lifecycle.},

  title={A Grid-based Model for Generating Scale-Free Networks}, 
  year={2019},
  abstract={It has been observed that the evolution of complex networks such as social networks is not a random process, there exist some key features which are responsible for their evolution. One such feature is the degree distribution of these networks which follow the power law i.e. P(k) ∝ k<sup>-γ</sup> where γ is a parameter whose value is typically in the range 2 < γ < 3 and such networks are called scale-free networks [4]. In this paper, we formulate a model for generating scale-free networks based on Baraba̅si-Albert model [6], using insights from elementary Euclidean Geometry that takes into account the geometrical location of the nodes instead of their degrees for new connections. We show that our model generates scale-free networks experimentally and provide a mathematical proof for the correctness of the fact that the degree distribution in generated networks indeed follows the power law. We also validate our model on Erdös collaboration network of mathematicians.},
