I am a senior undergraduate student at the [RV College of Engineering, Bangalore](https://rvce.edu.in/). I will be joining [KIXLAB](https://kixlab.org/) and working under the supervision of [Prof. Juho Kim](http://juhokim.com/) during next the winter semester as a visiting student researcher at KAIST University. Previously, I have interned at [Samsung R&D Institute India - Bangalore (SRIB)](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b), [SCCI Labs @Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar](http://sccilabs.org/) & [Hasura Technologies](https://hasura.io/).

I am broadly interested in problems that lie at the intersection of Computer Science and Social Sciences, specific domains include **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)**, and **Human-Centered Machine Learning**. And I am always open to new exciting research problems in other related domains! 

Recently, I have been focusing on data-driven interactive systems that support interaction at scale for solving social-computational problems. I am also interested in theoretical and experimental research to better understand and model human behavior in technological systems.


In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, TV series, and Anime (big fan of [Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) だってばよ!), and playing table tennis.
