I am a senior undergraduate student at the [RV College of Engineering, Bangalore](https://rvce.edu.in/). I will be joining [KIXLAB](https://kixlab.org/) and working under the supervision of [Prof. Juho Kim](http://juhokim.com/) during next the winter semester as a visiting student researcher at KAIST University. Previously, I have interned at [Samsung R&D Institute India - Bangalore (SRIB)](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b), [SCCI Labs @Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar](http://sccilabs.org/) & [Hasura Technologies](https://hasura.io/).

I am broadly interested to explore the domain of **Human-AI Interaction** or **Human-Centered Machine Learning**, ie. the entire spectrum of human interaction with machine intelligence, from making AI accessible for everyone to understanding the impact of AI in human lives as well as building **data-driven interactive systems**, by combining machine and human intelligence, that support **interaction at scale** for solving social-computational problems. 

Apart from these topics, I am also interested in **Computational Social Science** and **Data Science**, specifically in understanding and modeling human behavior in technological systems such as **online social networks** and **Wikipedia**. And I am always open to new exciting research problems in other related domains! 

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, TV series, and Anime (big fan of [Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) だってばよ!), and playing table tennis.
