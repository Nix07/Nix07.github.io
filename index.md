Recently, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering from [RV College of Engineering, Bangalore, India](https://rvce.edu.in/) with a focus on electrical and computer science.


During winter (2020) and summer (2019), I interned at [KIXLAB](https://kixlab.org/) and worked under the supervision of [Dr. Juho Kim](http://juhokim.com/), associate professor at KAIST. Previously, I have interned at [Samsung R&D Institute India - Bangalore (SRIB)](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b), [SCCI Labs](http://sccilabs.org/) under the guidance of [Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar](http://www.iitrpr.ac.in/sudarshan-iyengar), associate professor at Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, & [Hasura Technologies](https://hasura.io/).

Although my research interests are still evolving, I am broadly interested to explore the domain of **Human-AI Interaction**, **Human-Centered AI**, and **Interactive Machine Learning**, ie. the entire spectrum of human interaction with machine intelligence, from making AI accessible for everyone to understanding the impact of AI in human lives as well as building **reliable intelligent systems**, by combining machine and human intelligence, that support **interaction at scale** for solving social-computational problems. In this respect, I am currently learning about **machine learning** and **human-computer interaction**. 

Apart from these topics, I am also interested in **Computational Social Science**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Data Science**, specifically in understanding and modeling human behavior in technological systems such as **online social networks** and **Wikipedia**. And I am always open to new exciting research problems in other related domains! 

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, documentaries, and Anime (big fan of [Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) だってばよ!), as well as playing chess and table tennis.
